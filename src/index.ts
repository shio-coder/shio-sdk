 * Notify Shio to execute an auction with the given transaction bytes.

 * transaction along with successful bids will be submitted on behalf of the user. 
 * All this happens behind the scene, and by the time executeTransactionBlock call is made to the dAppâ€™s
 * Wallet SDK, the user transaction would have already been sequenced and executed, in whice case, 
 * the previous execution result will be returned immediately, making the whole process transparent.

 * @param encodedTxData Base64-encoded string of the transaction bytes (represents TransactionData).
 * @param encodedSig Base64-encoded string of the signature bytes (represents Signature).
 * @returns A promise that resolves when a sufficient delay has passed, or an error occurs.
